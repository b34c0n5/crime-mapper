# Enabling cyber investigations from a browser
**A prototype tool for mapping cyber crime**  

Created by **@UK_Daniel_Card**  

The experimental version is the live, bleeeding edge version (Live Demo is largely where I'm storing a relatively stable version... but this is all DEV!)

IF YOU WANT TO REALLY TEST THIS, PLEASE RUN IT LOCALLY WITH A LOCAL CORS PROXY (There is one provided in this repo, an online CORS proxy is planned for the future!)

### Features  
- Import and Export to JSON
- FREE Enrichments with GOOGLE, SHODAN INTERNETDB, HUDSON ROCK (more to come!)
- Runs locally or via GitHub Pages
- Includes a POC local CORS proxy - you need to run this using node and run the html file locally as well!
- Powered by an external JS library and third-party API keys (*BYOK - Bring Your Own Keys*)
- Be realistic with performance and scale assumptions/expectations - this is an in browser tool, it's purpose is for analysing phishing sites, scamming sites and small attack surfaces. Realistically above 1000 entities and you may have performance issues, the constraints are on the host machine specifications but even on a high end rig you likely will have issues above 4000 entities.

### Bug 1: UI Not Visible on Loading index.html
- **Date Reported**: [Current Date]
- **Status**: Open
- **Description**: When loading `index.html`, the UI frame is visible, but there are no contents displayed within the frame.
- **Steps to Reproduce**:
  1. Open `index.html` in a browser (preferably through a local web server to handle CORS issues).
  2. Observe that the basic structure or frame of the application loads, but no UI components (like controls, network visualization, etc.) are visible.
- **Possible Causes**:
  - JavaScript modules might not be loading due to CORS restrictions if not served through a local server.
  - Initialization of UI components in `main.js` or related scripts might be failing.
  - Missing or incorrect DOM elements required by the application components.
- **Root Cause Analysis**:
  - After reviewing the console output, all initialization steps in `main.js` are completing successfully, including importing modules, initializing error handler, configuration, model, and controller.
  - UI components are being initialized as 'placeholders' according to logs (e.g., 'TopBarComponent initialized'), but no content is rendered into the DOM.
  - The most likely root cause is that the UI components, although initialized, lack the necessary rendering logic to populate the DOM elements (like `#top-bar`, `#controls-panel`, etc.) with content as was done in the original `experimental_mapper.html`.
  - Additionally, if rendering depends on events like `Controller:StateUpdated`, these events are not being listened to or triggered (as seen with 'EventBus: No listeners for Controller:StateUpdated'), preventing UI updates.
- **Recommended Actions**:
  1. Verify that each UI component (`TopBarComponent.js`, `ControlsComponent.js`, etc.) has the necessary logic to render content into their respective DOM elements. If they are placeholders, implement the rendering logic to populate the DOM with UI elements as per the original application.
  2. Update each component's initialization or rendering method in `AppController.js` or individual component files to log when they attempt to manipulate the DOM, confirming if rendering is attempted and if it fails.
  3. Ensure that `AppController.js` triggers an initial rendering or state update event (e.g., `Controller:StateUpdated`) after all components are initialized to prompt UI rendering.
  4. Use browser developer tools to inspect the DOM after page load to check if any content has been added to placeholder elements (`#top-bar`, `#controls-panel`, etc.). If not, confirm the issue is with rendering logic.
  5. Ensure the application is served through a local web server to handle CORS issues with ES6 modules (e.g., use `python3 -m http.server 8000` and access via `http://localhost:8000/index.html`).
- **Notes**:
  - Ensure the file is served via a local web server (e.g., `http-server`, `live-server`, or `python -m http.server 8000`) to handle CORS issues with ES6 modules.
  - Check browser console for any JavaScript errors that might indicate issues with module loading or initialization.
  - Console output confirms initialization steps complete, but UI rendering does not occur, pointing to incomplete component rendering logic.
